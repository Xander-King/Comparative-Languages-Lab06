#  Lab 6

##  Demo Code
There are several demo programs in this repo. 
I will use these in the lecture and you should be able to follow along. 

Ideally, you will use VSCode with the CSharp and Cpontainer extensions. 
I will also use the dontnetfiddle website to demo some programs, but you must be able to run them from a terminal as well. 


For checking your programs I will use the command line to compile code

```
mcs Program.cs /UNSAFE
```
and I will run your programs from the command line as well
```
mono Program.exe
```  
Of course, replace 'Program' with the name of your file....

> NOTE:  You may see me using `csc` to compile the code,  that is the native Windows CSharp compiler. We will be using the Mono cross-platform version. 

##  Task
Write a program in C# that asks the user for a color, a noun, and a name. 
Display the poem:

```
 Roses are {COLOR}
 {Noun} are blue,
 {Name} loves you. 
```

Substituting the values provided as input. 

In addition, make sure you can compile and run the example code. 

## Testing your solution

As always you can type
```
make check
```
