#  Lab 6

##  Getting Started
Make sure to fork this repo.  
Then, clone your fork into your docker machine. 

##  Demo Code
There are several demo programs in this repo. 
I will use these in the lecture and you should be able to follow along. 

Ideally, you will use Visual Stusio (Windows) or [Mono Develop](https://www.monodevelop.com/download) on OSX or linux. 

For checking your programs I will use the command line to compile code

```
csc Program.cs /UNSAFE
```
and I will run your programs from the command line as well
```
mono Program.exe
```  
Of course, replace 'Program' with the name of your file....

##  Task
Write a program in C# that asks the user for a color, a noun, and a name. 
Display the poem:

```
 Roses are {COLOR}
 {Noun} are blue,
 {Name} loves you. 
```

Substituting the values provided as input. 

In addition, make sure you can compile and run the example code. 

## Testing your solution

As always you can type
```
make check
```

## Submitting your solution 
Please submit a link to your fork to canvas.
